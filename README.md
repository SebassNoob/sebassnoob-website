## SebassNoob-website

A repo for my personal website (reworked). Written with Next.js and Flask.

### Setup

Prerequisites:
```
    python >=3.11
    typescript
    make
    docker compose
    npm, pip

```

Run the following commands in order:

```
    make build
    make run
```
This will start a docker network on your local machine. Then go to ``localhost:3000`` to access frontend.

To stop the container,

```
    make fuckoff
```
