- Knowledge of **Linux** and **Docker**, and various devops tools (**github-actions, make, eslint**). Able to deploy applications locally or to cloud platforms.

- Able to secure applications with **common security measures** to prevent XSS, SQL injection, Denial-of-Service etc.

To be frank, I've had to learn some of these concepts the hard way -- having had to experience firsthand what happens when a user drops my database, as well as being repeatedly DOS'ed by someone who found my private api endpoint. However, I've learned how to better protect applications by testing them to **prevent** such security threats from occuring again. Other than this, I've also picked up skills to **speed up** the development and deployment process, all while making code more **secure**.
