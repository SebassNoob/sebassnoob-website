- Fluent in **Python**, **JS/TS** and **Java**. Able to build full stack applications with **Flask**, **Express**, **PostgreSQL**.

- Experience with python data science libraries such as **pandas**, **numpy** and **matplotlib**. Able to analyse data and present them in a meaningful way

To be honest there's nothing much to say about these general programming lanugages. Currently I most enjoy writing **Typescript** the most as it combines best of type safety from Java and the dynamicism of JS/Python. However, these langauges each have different use cases and different strengths and weaknesses, which I've come to embrace wholeheartedly.

In terms of Data Science, I really love how python libraries are able to automate tasks that otherwise would have been much more tedious with tools like **Excel** (or god forbid, analyzing by hand).
