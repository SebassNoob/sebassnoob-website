- 1.5 years experience building websites with **React** using **Next.js** and **Vite**; and 3.5 years with pure **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**.

- ~2 years creating various forms of media -- from audio to image to video, with tools such as **Photoshop**, **VideoPad + SoundPad**, **SVGator** and many more!

When I first started working with the internet, I felt overwhelmed and bewildered -- but at the same time **marvelled** at its complexity. Over time, I've come to realise that it's one of the best ways to express one's **creativity** with the world through the ubiquitous internet. Currently, I'm on the hunt for knowledge of cool **frameworks** to push the boundaries of what makes web development possible.
